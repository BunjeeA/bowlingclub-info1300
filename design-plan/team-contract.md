# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    Ensure good communication and teamwork to complete a polished and complete website that fit the audience's goal.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Make sure we dont interupt people when they are expressing their views. Give everyone their opportunity to speak.
    - Treat everyone equally.
    - Ensure good communications between team members.
    - Ensure each person have equal and fair work loads.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will mostly communicate over group text and zoom for the ease of access. We will communicate once a week.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    Primarily we will communicate with our client using email. We will use zoom for meetings.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Outreach: connecting to our client. Set expectations and communicate on project information.
    - Coordination: set up meeting, coordinate between team members. Facilitate the meetings and to monitor the scheduled plan and dues. Warn other team members when they are not completing their promised works or assigned work.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We should ensure good communication between each member to prevent the need for ending up in this kind of situation. As a last resort, we will warn the team member by making clear that their irresponsibility will be seen from the git commit records. We can warn the member that we will report this issue via the forms at the end of the project if this continues.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    We try to avoid disagreement, but when we reach disagreements, we should make sure that we communicate effectively in a rational way. Everyone should have their opinion voiced and discussed equally. We could potentially vote to make decision if nessesary. We will aim to avoid emotional responses.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    We decided that we will revisit the contract at the end of each meeting and discuss whether or not to modify.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    We agreed to go to the Dairy Bar together after we finished the project!


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
